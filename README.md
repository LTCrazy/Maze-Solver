# Maze-Solver
Uninformed and informed search program

Given a two-dimensional maze with a starting position and a goal position, the task of this project is to write a Java
program called FindPath.java that assists a robot in solving the maze by finding a path from the start
node to the goal node (as described below) if one exists. The program must accept command line
arguments in the following format:
$ java FindPath maze search-method
The first argument, maze, is the path to a text file containing the input maze as described below, and the
second argument, search-method, can be either “bfs” or “astar” indicating whether the search
method to be used is breadth-first search (BFS) or A* search, respectively.
